  <p>Some cards of effects might not yet be clear in the CRD yet, but Riot keeps interacting with the community and answered some of our questions.</p>

  <h3 id="buffs-as-game-objects" class="mt-4 mb-2">Cithria of Cloudfield & Wildclaw Shaman (Buffs as Game Objects)</h3>
  <p>If Cithria of Cloudfield has no buffs and Wildclaw Shaman is played, both triggers are simultaneous and the player can order them as they choose. Cithria of Cloudfield can first receive a buff, then Wildclaw Shaman can spend it to receive a buff and ready itself.<br/>

  <h3 id="sett-legend" class="mt-4 mb-2">Sett Legend Ability</h3>
  <p>Rule 572.2. is incorrect and is due to be removed. Sett's Legend ability should only be a replacement effect, not a Triggered Ability. Replace the card text's "when" with "if".<br/>
    This intercedes on any other process occurring.<br/>
