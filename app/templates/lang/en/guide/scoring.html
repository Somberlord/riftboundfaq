  <h2 class="mb-3">Scoring</h2>
  <p><strong>Scoring</strong> is a specific term in Riftbound. Gaining a victory point is not always considered <strong>Scoring</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>Scoring</strong> can only be done at a <strong>Battlefield</strong> by <strong>Hold</strong> or <strong>Conquer</strong>:</p>
  <ul class="list-group themed-list mb-3">
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Hold</strong>: A player has <strong>Control</strong> of a <strong>Battlefield</strong> during their Beginning Phase.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Conquer</strong>: A player gains <strong>Control</strong> of a <strong>Battlefield</strong> they did not <strong>Score</strong> this turn.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each <strong>Battlefield</strong> can only be <strong>Scored</strong> by a player once per turn. Gaining <strong>Control</strong> of a <strong>Battlefield</strong> that has already been <strong>Scored</strong> this turn does not allow a player to score, and that player does not <strong>Conquer</strong> this <strong>Battlefield</strong>.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Final Point</h2>
  <ul class="list-group themed-list mb-3">
    <li class="list-group-item">
      If a player is one point away from the Victory Score, they must satisfy the following when <strong>Scoring</strong>:
      <ul class="list-group themed-list mt-2">
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Scoring</strong> through <strong>Hold</strong>: they score the Final Point (and win the game).</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Scoring</strong> through <strong>Conquer</strong>: they must have <strong>Scored</strong> every <strong>Battlefield</strong> this turn (both <strong>Hold</strong> and <strong>Conquer</strong> count). If a player <strong>Scores</strong> via <strong>Conquer</strong> and has not <strong>Scored</strong> each other <strong>Battlefield</strong>, they do not gain the Final Point and instead draw a card.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">The Final Point can also be gained by cards and effects that give you points without <strong>Scoring</strong> (Burn Out, Ahri, etc.).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
