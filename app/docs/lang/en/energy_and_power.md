# Energy & Power
There are 2 Resources in Riftbound  : **Energy** & **Power**
 - **Energy** is represented by Numerical Values, and is color agnostic : :1Energy:
 - **Power**, which is represented by the Domain symbols and is color specific : :FuryPower:

The simplest and most common way to generate these resources is with your **Runes**. 
You **Exhaust** :exhaust: a **Rune** to generate **Energy**, and you **Recycle** a **Rune** to generate **Power**.

Both resources can also be created by other abilities and effects, such as exhausting a Seal for **Power**. 

Whenever you generate either resource, they go into a virtual pool that can be used to pay for Costs of the appropriate type and that pool doesn't empty until the end of the turn, and at the end of draw phase. 

Note that some cards and effects can cost *both* **Energy** and **Power**.
