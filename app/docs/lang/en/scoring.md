### Scoring

**Scoring** is a specific term in Riftbound. **Scoring a point** is not always considered Scoring.

**Scoring** can only be done at a **Battlefield** by **Hold** or **Conquer**:

  - **Hold**: A player has **Control** of a **Battlefield** during their Beginning Phase.
  - **Conquer**: A player gains **Control** of a *Battlefield* they did not **Score** this turn.

Each **Battlefield** can only be Scored by a player once per turn. Gaining **Control** of a **Battlefield** that has already been **Scored** this turn does not allow a player to score, and that player does not **Conquer** this **Battlefield**.

## Final Point

If a player is one point away from the Victory Score, they must satisfy the following when **Scoring**:
  - **Scoring** through **Hold**: they score the Final Point (and win the game).
  - **Scoring** through **Conquer**: they must have **Scored** every **Battlefield** this turn (both **Hold** and **Conquer** count). If a player **Scores** via **Conquer** and has not **Scored** each other **Battlefield**, they do not gain the Final Point and instead draw a card.
  - The Final Point can also be gained by cards and effects that give you points without **Scoring** (Burn Out, Ahri, etc.).
