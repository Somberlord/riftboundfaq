## Abilities

Cards in Riftbound can have many different **abilities**. All abilities belong to one of **four categories**:

### Passive Abilities

- Statements of **fact**
- Can be conditional, recognized by the words **While** or **If**
- Permanents are affected by passive abilities as soon as they enter the board
  - A 4 :[might] unit played onto **Trifarian War Camp** counts as Mighty for **Relentless Storm**

### Activated Abilities

- Can be recognized by the presence of a **colon** (":")
- Text before the colon indicates a **cost** that has to be paid to activate an ability.
- Text after the colon indicates the **effect** of the ability.
- Can only be activated on **your turn**, outside of a **showdown**, when the chain is **empty**
- When the cost is paid, they are put on the **chain**
- Other players can **react**
  - Abilities that **add** resources cannot be reacted to
- Once every player has passed, the ability **resolves**

### Triggered Abilities

- Happen when a certain **condition** is met
- Can be recognized by the words **when** or **at**
- When the condition is met, **triggered abilities** are put on the **chain**
- Other people can **react**
- Can trigger on **any turn**, during **any game state**
- Multiple abilities can trigger at the same time
  - The **controller** of the triggered abilities decides the **order** of their triggers
  - If abilities from **different players** trigger, they are put on the chain in **turn order**, starting with the **turn player**

Triggered abilities are **not optional**. They trigger whenever their condition is met.

### Replacement Effects

- Can alter the **execution** of other game effects
- Can be recognized by the word **instead**
- If multiple replacement effects apply to the **same event**, the controller of the **relevant object** can choose the order
  - If a player controls both **Zhonyas** and **Sett, The Boss**, they can choose which effect to use when a unit would die
